# CLO - Flutter Mobile Application Project

Welcome to our Flutter mobile application project repository! This repository contains the source code for a mobile application developed using Flutter, a popular framework for building cross-platform applications and MVC pattern to help us build apps easier. Whether you're a developer, contributor, or just curious about our project, this README will guide you through the essentials.

## Project Overview

Our mobile application project aims to provide a platform for facilitating circular fashion through a subscription-based model tailored to each customer's style preferences. By embracing circular fashion principles, we aim to promote sustainability within the fashion industry by encouraging reusability and reducing waste. Join us in revolutionizing the way we approach fashion consumption and sustainability. With Flutter, we can achieve a beautiful, native-like user interface and excellent performance across both Android and iOS platforms.
